##My Learning

During this project, I trained the image classification model on my CPU (Intel Iris Xe Graphics). Since Intel integrated GPUs are not optimized for deep learning computations,
the training process was quite slow. As the number of epochs increased, I observed that the modelâ€™s accuracy gradually improved, but each epoch took a significant amount of time to complete. 
This experience helped me understand how computational hardware impacts training speed and reinforced the importance of using an NVIDIA GPU for faster and more efficient deep learning model training.
